## Meal Entry

Using the Nutritionix API, users can enter a quantity and name of a food and add it to a new meal. Meals can then be added towards daily totals and saved to be viewed later.

## Goal Setting and Tracking

Goals can be set for calories and 3 other major macronutrients: fat, protein, and carbohydrates. Daily progress can then be viewed to allow users to visually approximate how they are doing in regard to their goals.

## Aesthetic Options

Available in three distinct flavors.
